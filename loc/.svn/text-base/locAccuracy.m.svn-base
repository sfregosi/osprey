% Given arr (a set of phone positions as a 2 x N array), calculate and plot
% the accuracy of locations calculated with the time-delay estimation method.
%
% For example, this one looks pretty:
% arr = [0 0; 0 1; 1 1; 1 0]' - 0.5 + rand(2,4)/1e5; locAccuracy
%
% This works only for 2-dimensional locations.
