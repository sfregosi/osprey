function [m,b,y1] = linefit(x,y,x1)
%linefit	Fit a line to a set of (x,y) points
%
% [m,b] = linefit(x,y)
%    Given vectors x and y of the same length, solve for best-fitting m and b 
%    in  y = m*x + b.  "Best-fitting" is in the least-squares sense.  This
%    could be done with polyfit(x,y,1), but this special case is faster by a
%    factor of 5 or so.
%
% [m,b,y1] = linefit(x,y,x1)
%    If a third arg x1 is given, also calculate y1 = m*x1 + b.
